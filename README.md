# Overview

As a software engineer, this project gave me the opportunity to become more familiar with Java and Android Studio. Before creating a PDF converter app, I did not have experience with either of them. After taking the time to create an android app, I have become more comfortable with using Java and Android Studio.

The PDF converter is an app that asks a user to input some text into a textbox. After a user has typed something in, they are given the option to press a conversion button. Once a user has pressed the conversion button, they are able to view a PDF of the text that they typed by clicking a button below that says view PDF document.

The reason that this app was created was so that I could become more familiar with app development, Android Studio, and Java.

Down below is a link to a video demonstrating the PDF converter that I created.

# Development Environment

The development environment that I used was Android Studio which is a development environment powered by IntelliJ. 

I decided to use the Java language for my PDF coverter app. The libraries that I used were itextpdf and an android PDF viewer libary provided by barteksc. They can be found down below.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I need to pay more attention to the warning errors and try to fix them rather than accepting that my code is able to run.
* I need to improve with my creativity skills when it comes to creating layouts like the XML files that I created.
* I need to spend more time familiarizing myself with development environments so that it becomes easier to start writing programs.
